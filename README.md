# Chessboard Square Detection

A Python script that detects and counts black and white squares on a cropped chessboard image using OpenCV and grid-based analysis.

## Features

- Loads and displays a grayscale chessboard image
- Divides the image into a 5x5 grid
- Classifies each square as black or white based on pixel intensity
- Counts and displays the number of black and white squares
- Validates the counts against expected chessboard patterns

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for display in Colab)
